                <p>When I was a kid, I was an animal lover, and one day I was walking down the street and I saw a cat with a serious injury, I wanted to help him but I couldn’t because I was small and I couldn’t find anyone to ask him to help this poor cat then he died in front of my eyes at that time-there I was very sad and I wondered how many animals there are in this situation all over the world so I told myself when I grow up I will try to do something that can help these animals </p> <br> <p> Now that I had the opportunity to make an application web as a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/"> Holberton School</a> I chose to make a site that allows people who find animals that need help to put an alert on the map with location, photo and description of the situation for someone to help them.
